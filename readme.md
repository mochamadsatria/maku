# MAKU (Makanan Ku)


## Background
There are over **192 million people** that do not have enough food to eat everyday according to what PBB reported. Especially with Covid-19 and war going on, it has been getting worse. It is reported that the number has **increased by 40 million people in the last year**. Hunger is a major issue in **53 countries** currently. Countries including Afghanistan,Republic Kongo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Sudan, Suriah and Yaman.  Due to the prolonged drought, consistent violence and rising food prices, it is leading more than **6 million people** in Somalia in risk of hunger. 

Indonesia itself disposes **36 million tons of food waste** per year in the period of 2000-2019. So how can we reduce that? **MAKU**, aims to reduce food waste in Indonesia and help lower income family backgrounds.

## What it does
**MAKU** for commercial aims to help those restaurants who have excess food _that is still good enough and doesn't exceed the expiration date_ to sell it on our platform at a reasonable price rather than being thrown away. While it is not fresh enough Maku will help the restaurant to recook the food to result in other dishes that are still fresh enough to sell *(ex: rice -> fried rice)*.

**MAKU** for individuals (not commercial) aims to help those, who have excess food _that is still good enough_ and wanna donate it (or even some people that just wanna share food), by advertising their food on our platform. That means Maku will help unite those people who wanna donate their food with some people that need it.

## How we built it


## What's next for MAKU (Makanan Ku) 
Maku will focus to expand and increase our partnership with all restaurants in Indonesia. We hope that many people will know Maku and **work together to reduce hunger and food waste in Indonesia**.
